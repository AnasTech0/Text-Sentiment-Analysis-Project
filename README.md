This project is a web application for analyzing text sentiment. It leverages the power of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library for sentiment classification and utilizes Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface.

Here's a breakdown of the key technologies:

Hugging Face: Provides access to pre-trained sentiment analysis models, reducing development time and effort.
Streamlit: Enables the creation of a web application without extensive web development experience.
The app allows users to input text, and the pre-trained model classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly experience for interacting with the model and visualizing the results.


This project demonstrates the efficient combination of pre-trained models and Streamlit for building a real-world NLP application.

## üöÄ About Me
I'm currently a student    deeply fascinated by the world of artificial intelligence and data science.    I love using Python    to bring my ideas to life, and I'm also comfortable with web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript     .

My skillset includes:

Machine Learning: Training computers to learn from data!

Data Analysis: Uncovering hidden insights from information.

Generative AI: ü™Ñ Creating new and exciting things with the power of AI.
Here are some cool projects I've been working on:

->Ed Tech Bot - Your 24/7 AI Study Buddy! 

I designed and built an AI-powered Q&A chatbot    using Google's Palm & LaMDA technology.    This little helper provides real-time student support,  ‚Äç  integrates with educational platforms    to answer FAQs with personalized responses, and is always available for 24/7 assistance!  ‚è∞  It's all about improving accessibility and making learning a breeze.

->SenticAI - Unveiling the Emotions in Your Text!‚ú®

This is a web application I built to analyze the sentiment of text.    It leverages the power of pre-trained models from the awesome Hugging Face library    to understand if something is positive, negative, or neutral.     The user-friendly interface    makes it easy to play around with different text and see the results in a flash!  ‚ö°Ô∏è

I'm always looking for new ways to use AI and data science to make a positive impact.    Feel free to connect and chat about these amazing fields!
